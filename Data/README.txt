Title of the study
Biogeography of ubiquitous Labyrinthula zosterae and emergence of a novel seagrass pathogen

Short summary of the study
This study investigates the genetic diversity of the protist Labyrinthula zosterae (Lz) in eelgrass ecosystems from Alaska to Southern California, identifying two dominant pathogenic strains. We found that pathogenic Lz dominated 10 sites, while non-pathogenic strains were more prevalent at 11 others, with a novel strain associated with crescent-shaped lesions prevalent in Northern California. The high proportion of region-specific ASVs suggests localized ecological drivers of diversity, while the widespread occurrence of some taxa indicates their persistence across various habitats, informing eelgrass conservation and restoration efforts.
